I have been to Samaroh at Lavelle road. Quantity and quality wise it's okay. Presentation of food is great.\n\nAmbience: 5/5\nThe theme of Samaroh is fabulous. The combination of pink and yellow is the perfect blend which goes with food and your mood.\n\nService: 3/5\nAgain, Samaroh at Lavelle road is much nicer than the one at The Bay. The experience was not up to the mark, as I have visited Samaroh with my parents, keeping in mind that the theme is pure vegetarian with royal food.\n\nVerdict: I would recommend, the reception of the guests should be warm as per Rajasthani culture, as the guest would definitely like to enjoy the traditional settings by coming to such restaurants.""), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  A perfect place for large family get-togethers, esp if the majority of them are vegetarians or veg-preferring.. the folks here have a diverse array of vegetarian dishes which work well for the most part.. their wide selection of starters is especially noteworthy.. also noteworthy is their exceptional attention to detail, their obsession with getting the authenticity right..The menu items are a bit on the pricier side though ..'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  Why should you go this place:\n* For some yummy North Indian Veg food\n* You are looking for a buffet place\n* You prefer quality over quantity\n* You want to eat good food and not be bombarded with useless items just for the name sake which you would not enjoy at all'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  We went to this place as a group of 18 members on a Sunday afternoon. Overall, the place is average from ambience point of view. The first thing which I liked was the cutlery which were used to serve various items, each cutlery is so cute and well thought out before procuring. Each item came one after another on table with completely different cutlery. Coming to food, I felt the food was average too, nothing to complaint or praise either. However, the service boys were quite prompt and cheerful while serving. One of the roti serving guy, even forced us to eat extra chapatis. Overall, good experience as we went in big group!!'), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  There are more than one reason to visit this restaurant located in the Bay..\nFirst reason is of course food - food is delicious and sumptuous.. The quantity is just right..\nStarters are good.. Main course is hot and tasty. Deserts are just yummy..\nSecond reason is ambience and service.. Very good indeed..\nThird and probably most important is cutlery.. It is just amazing.. It feels great to eat and drink with the brass..\nI highly recommend this restaurant..'), ('Rated 4.0', ""RATED\n  Samaroh in RMZ bay is a visit to traditional Indian food. The aura of the place is charming and the food will remind you of the flavors of India!\nTheir menu keeps changing daily and they offer one big thali at 699 and smaller thali combos around 300.\nI wasn't hungry so I tried the smaller combo of paneer roti dal sabzi with lassi. The taste was good although my only complaint would be the quantity of the phulkas. They served only 3 in the plate and I don't think it will be enough for anyone. They should increase the quantity for the price that they charge.\nService is good and the restaurant's menu prices includes service charge as well."")]"
